### SodaIpsum Landing Page Practice using Bootstrap 5.3, CSS and HTML

### About this project
I'm Michele Quartararo, also know as "**BARCODE**" or "**CODICEaBARRE**" in italian.

As I'm learning CSS3 and HTML5 I've decided to test my skills by building a personal landing page project designed and coded by me. 

I called this Project "**SodaIpsum**", in the honor of the common Lorem Ipsum system used for placeholder text.
